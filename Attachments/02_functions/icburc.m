%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Function for the estimation of initial contats (ICs) of the stride cycle 
% during walking activity, starting from the antero-posterior (AP) -with 
% reference to the walking motor task- trunk accelerations.
% This method tries to overcome the main Achille's heel of the method 
% proposed in [1] which is the missed or erroneous detection of a 
% zero-crossing (ZC), as starting point to identify an IC, in case of 
% gait cycles in which abnormal accelerating patterns are superimposed to 
% the standard human accelerating pattern (which for example may occur in 
% the gait of a pathological subject). Indeed in this case the 
% superimposition of abnormal oscillations to the standard step-cycle 
% middle envelope of the gait may not result in an AP acceleration ZC, 
% which is at the basis of both the methods proposed in [1].
% To overcome the problem, the implemented method first segments the signal
% into different step cycles, the segmentation into different step cycles 
% is performed on the basis of a step-related middle envelope easily 
% obtainable through a low-pass (LP) filtering of the AP acceleration 
% signal with a cut off frequency slightly higher (125%) than the 
% step-related harmonic of the gait*ยน, adaptively estimated for the gait 
% under analysis -choosing a LP filtering cut off frequency slightly higher
% than the step cycle related harmonic allows to best preserve periodic 
% fluctuations related to the step cycle while smoothing all the other 
% fluctuations, in this manner the step related pattern in highlighted-. 
% Then for each step-cycle identified the method searches the greatest 
% deceleration pattern -defined as the treat of the step cycle along which 
% there is the greatest monotonous deceleration- which is associated to an 
% IC happening. Finally the instant is identified as the median time point 
% between the instant of the acceleration peak of this pattern and the 
% instant in which, during this pattern, the signal assumes values lower 
% than the envelope; choosing the median point of these two allows for 
% greater robustness and highness of the method's performance in terms of 
% accuracy with respect to choosing the instant in which the peak occurred 
% (if during the decelerating the pattern no such straddle happens then 
% simply the peak is taken as IC instant).
% Moreover the fact that the method does not rely on ZCs instants makes it
% almost independent from signals' slow oscillations affliction not related
% to the gait cycle itself (which reflects the non-stationarity of the 
% motor task or eventual instrumentation's bias instability -even if
% usually this is not the case of accelerometry signals-) and in general 
% much more robust than the method proposed in [1] to the parameters choice
% of signals pre-processing stage, such as the cut off frequencies of the 
% denoising LP (see lp input parameter paragraph below) and high-pass (HP, 
% see hp input parameter paragraph below) filtering stages.
% As this method guarantees, assumed to correctly estimate the step related
% harmonic as the proper one and not as the stride related harmonic, to 
% find an IC for each step cycle, if it happens that during gaits with 
% impairment some step segmentation is lost (not identifiable on the step 
% related middle envelope), a correction mechanism is implemented so that
% an additional IC is searched even if the related step cycle is not 
% identifiable. In particular a check on the length of the step cycle is 
% done and if it lasts more than the 175% of the average step cycle length 
% (calculated as the inverse of the step cycle armonic) than the 2 greatest
% deceleration patterns are selected, instead of only the greatest, for 
% that actually segmented step cycle.
% ||| *ยน: usually to find the step-related armonic in healthy subjects' 
%         gait is quite an easy task as it is sufficient to search for the 
%         spectral component carrying the maximum power in the signal, but 
%         in case a gait with pathology is analized this may not be true 
%         anymore (especially in case of significantly asymmetric gaits). 
%         Indeed in this case the periodicity of the walking activity may 
%         become coarsely the one of the gait cycle instead than the one of
%         the step cycle. 
%         Thus, in case of plausible high asymmetry of the gait due to 
%         different status of the two hemiparts of the subject from which  
%         the signal has been probed, the step-related harmonic of each of 
%         the sequences in input is found, instead of simply looking for  
%         the armonic carrying the higher contribute of power, firstly
%         performing a power spectral density (PSD) estimation of the 
%         sequence, then the harmonic carrying the maximum power contribute 
%         is chosen as plausible step-related harmonic candidate, finally a
%         check is made looking for the local maxima on the power spectral 
%         estimate (PSE) in a range of frequencies nearly around the double
%         of the candidate harmonic: if the ratio between the candidate 
%         harmonic contribute and its subsequent harmonic is greater than a
%         crisp thresold of 3.5 then the candidate is taken as the 
%         step-related harmonic (whereas it had been the gait cycle related 
%         harmonic a greater quantity of power would have been carried by 
%         the latter); otherwise the candidate is discarded and the 
%         step-related harmonic is set as the value equal to the subsequent
%         harmonic armonic in correspondence of the local maxima. 
%         The indication of possible significantly asymmetric gait can be 
%         given as input to the function (see Name-Value Argument inputs 
%         below) to perform this check and eventually the aforementioned
%         correction mechanism.
%         Even if this mechanism is used to enhance the chance to 
%         automatically find the right step-related harmonic, if the gait
%         under analysis is compromised at such a level in which one of the
%         limbs does not apport motility during the motor task but rather 
%         is carried behind -thus being the active part of the walking 
%         activity only the other limb-, it may happen that the proper gait
%         cycle related harmonic is pretended to be the step-related one 
%         since all the contribute to motion during the gait cycle is given
%         by one limb only. This causing the loss of nearly half of the ICs
%         occurring during that gait, indeed even if the decelerating 
%         pattern due to IC is still detectable similarly to those of the 
%         non impaired limb, the problem in this case is that only one IC 
%         for each pretended step-cycle is detected, in particular the one 
%         associated to the greatest monotonous deceleration (the 
%         correction mechanism does not enter in action as the estimated 
%         step-cycle armonic is for real the gait-cycle related harmonic, 
%         i.e. lost step cycles do not lead to condition of having step 
%         cycle lasting longer than the pretended characteristic step cycle
%         period of the gait).
% ||| PLEASE NOTICE that to correctly read the help and comments of the 
% function also N-dimensional array with only the last dimension's size not
% equal to 1 will be improperly referred to as "vectors" even if N is 
% greater than 2; while when referring to "N-dimensional arrays" it is 
% meant to be any other type of N-dimensional array (i.e. when any other 
% than the last dimension's size is not equal to 1). This is to more easily
% manage the cases of N-dimensional "vector" arrays by the moment that

% INPUT ARGUMENTS:
%   - x: input sequence containing the AP accelerations. It can be a 
%        vector, a matrix or a N-dimensional array. If x is not a vector, 
%        then icburc treats as independent sequences data along dimension 
%        dim rather than along the first non-singleton dimension if dim is 
%        not given as input. 
%        The case of sequences in x made by less than 10 points is not 
%        treated by the function (which will throw an error in case) but 
%        shall be managed by the calling entity: the method ,for how it is 
%        implemented, likely would not find any reasonable result.
%        Moreover it is important to notice that even if works on sequences
%        of 11 points or longer, outputs may be no sense and/or highly 
%        inaccurate for sequences not containing at least few gait cycles).
%   - fs (optional): sampling frequency of the input sequence x in Hz.
%                    To not insert fs and still be able to set the value 
%                    for the next optional input parameters, set the value 
%                    of input parameter fs to [] (empty array).
%   - hp (optional): proper 2-element vector (row or column) or scalar 
%                    containing respectively at least the cut off frequency  
%                    and eventually the order for the Butterworth  
%                    anticausal high-pass (HP) filter of the AP 
%                    acceleration in x prior to the other steps. 
%                    The cut off frequency of this filtering stage should 
%                    be set according to low frequency oscillations which
%                    may affect the gait signals and on which there is no 
%                    interest, usually this is the case of low frequency 
%                    oscillations occurring due to not perfect stationarity 
%                    of the walk under analysis.
%                    Indeed either in laboratory set up walking trials or 
%                    in real-world walking, the motor task may be affected 
%                    by accelerations and decelerations. For example an 
%                    experimental set up may consist in acquiring signals 
%                    continuosly during a trial made up of many walking
%                    bouts (WBs), thus accelerations and decelerations are
%                    necessarely present, and in particular if the WBs are
%                    always of the same length scale there will be 
%                    oscillations always with a certain characteristic
%                    (average) period. The case of real-world gait is more 
%                    variegated by this point of view, but in general it is
%                    presumable to not to be interested in short WBs, in 
%                    which the task is highly not stationary and likely to 
%                    be affected by border effects that do not relate with
%                    the health status of the subject, thus a suggested
%                    value range for the cut off frequency for this 
%                    filtering stage is [0.1,0.25] Hz, which does not lead 
%                    to a deterioration of the information related to gait 
%                    cycles (in which the fundamental armonic is around
%                    1.5-2.5 Hz in healthy subjects) and allows for 
%                    attenuation of oscillations in WBs of 2-4 s or longer.
%                    A reasonably good and robust -in terms of filter 
%                    stability- value for the order of this filter is 4.
%                    icburc treats entered cut off frequency as non
%                    normalized so it should be bounded in range
%                    (0,Nyquist frequency), if a valid hp is entered fs is 
%                    mandatory and no longer optional.
%                    If hp is not given the default behaviour is to not to 
%                    perform such HP filtering; if only a scalar is given 
%                    it is treated as if it is the cut off frequency and
%                    the related order used for the filter is 4. 
%                    To use the default behaviour -i.e. no such HP 
%                    filtering- and still be able to set the value of the 
%                    next input parameters, set the value of this parameter
%                    to [] (empty array).
%   - lp (optional): proper 2-element vector (row or column) or scalar 
%                    containing respectively at least the cut off frequency
%                    and eventually the order for the Butterworth 
%                    anticausal LP filtering of the AP acceleration in x 
%                    prior to other steps in order to attenuate eventual 
%                    high frequency noise corrupting the signals. 
%                    According to [1] and established that armonics proper
%                    of the walking motor task do not exceed 25-35 Hz in 
%                    humans, the suggested value of cut off frequency at 
%                    this filtering stage is 20 Hz, while a reasonably good
%                    and robust -in terms of filter stability- value for 
%                    the order of this filter is 4. 
%                    icburc treats entered cut off frequency as non
%                    normalized so it should be bounded in range
%                    (0,Nyquist frequency), if a valid lp is entered fs is 
%                    mandatory and no longer optional.
%                    If lp is not given the default behaviour is to not to 
%                    perform such LP filtering; if only a scalar is given
%                    it is treated as if it is the cut off frequency and 
%                    the related order used for the filter is 4. 
%                    To use the default behaviour -i.e. no such LP 
%                    filtering- and still be able to set the value of the 
%                    next input parameters, set the value of this parameter
%                    to [] (empty array).
%   - dim (optional): dimension of x along which the function will operate
%                     treating the elements as vectors.
%                     By default icburc operates along the first
%                     non-singleton dimension of x. To use the default 
%                     behaviour for this optional parameter and still be 
%                     able to set the value for the next optional input 
%                     parameters, set the value of input parameter dim to

%    - TimeConversion: string scalar or character vector, specifies whether

%    - PSE: power spectra estimate (PSE) as PSD or power spectrum,

%           cycle related harmonic.
%           It can be a vector, a matrix or a N-dimensional array. If it is
%           a vector, icburc uses this as common spectral estimate for each
%           of the independent sequences in x (eventually only one); while 
%           if it is not then all the sizes except the one along the 
%           operating dimension shall match those of x and icburc treats as
%           independent PSEs data along this dimension.
%           If this Name-Value argument is not given as input then the PSE
%           of x is obtained from x with the default behaviour of pwelch

%                     reference points vector for each of the independent
%                     estimates.
%                     The function treats the frequency reference points as
%                     a non-normalized frequency reference in range 
%                     [0,Nyquist frequency], if a frequency reference is

%                     user; if only PSE is entered, then this is treated as 
%                     one sided PSE of a real signal, so the frequency 
%                     reference is created as a vector of N equidistant
%                     points in [0,Nyquist frequency] range, with N being
%                     the number of points of the given PSD estimates, also
%                     in this case fs is mandatory and no longer optional; 
%                     while if also PSE is not given the frequency
